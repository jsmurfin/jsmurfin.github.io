# About Me
## My Interests
I am interested in video games and that is my favorite hobby.
Most things to do with technology has come easier to me than others and I am also intereseted in technology.
I would like to have a job in the IT field and make games part time once I am comfortable enough with my life.
### Websites that I reccomend
- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com) - I find that Youtube is a great place to learn new things while also being entertained.
- [History](https://www.history.com) - I like the history channel website because they're a lot of interesting subjects discussed on it.
